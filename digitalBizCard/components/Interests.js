            <h3>Interests</h3>  
            <p>Since I was a little kid, I have been interested in art and design. Starting with cartoons and interior design as a youth, my tastes matured in college to culture, and art, and finally after college and into grad school I found a passion for visual and product design which culminated in a career in user experience. My interests have led to me explore the outdoors and travel to understand other cultures, art, and experiences all over the world. </p>
